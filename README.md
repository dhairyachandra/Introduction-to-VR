# Introduction to VR (Unity)
 The project built in the workshop is the Laser Cop Roomscale VR Game. It requires both a headset and controllers, but there is a test script that will allow for in-editor development for participants who did not bring a VR headset with them. While the game was designed to be eï¬ƒcient enough to run even on laptop, it will not work on mobile (and was not developed to work with mobile headsets). That said, everything within the game is fully compatible with HTC Vive, and Oculus Rift, and should be equally usable on any other PC headset.
